# Predictive_Coding
### Collaborators: Chenguang Li, Jonah Brenner, and Adam Boesky

This project explores a variation of the predictive coding (PC) model's capacity to:
1. Adapt to a changing reward landscapes.
2. Learn association.

All of the functionality used to define our PC agents can be found in `model.py`. In `moving_peak/`, we explore how PC agents respond to a changing reward landscape, and in `environmental_adaptation/` we see how an agent responds to stimuli associated with different reward landscapes.

This project was done as part of Harvard's **APPHY 286 - Inference, Information Theory, Learning and Statistical Mechanics** course taught by Sharad Ramanthan.
